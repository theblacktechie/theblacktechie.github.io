**Now with Comments!**

&nbsp;

For a blog, you need comments. Like all those other Jekyll themes, we baked in **Disqus**. It's easy to set up, it works, and it makes a static Jekyll blog more dynamic.

&nbsp;

If you want to use **Disqus Comments** with *Feeling Responsive*, just open `config.yml` and add your `disqus_shortname`. [More on how to use Disqus â€º](https://disqus.com/)

&nbsp;

By default, comments are turned off. You can customize the default behavior in `config.yml`.  
To **turn on comments**, just add `comments: true` to the front matter using the page layout `layout: page`.
