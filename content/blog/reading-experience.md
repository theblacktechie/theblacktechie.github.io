## Lato – A Sans Serif Typeface Family

*Lato* is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer **Łukasz Dziedzic**. *Lato* means “Summer” in Polish. In December 2010, the *Lato* family was published under the **Open Font License** by his foundry **tyPoland**, with support from **Google**.

> *I do not think of type as something that should be readable. It should be beautiful.*  
> – *Łukasz Dziedzic*

In the last ten or so years, during which Łukasz has been designing type, most of his projects were rooted in a particular **design task** that he needed to solve. With *Lato*, it was no different. Originally, the family was conceived as a set of **corporate fonts** for a large client—who in the end decided to go in a different stylistic direction. So the family became available for a **public release**.

When working on *Lato*, Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would **sound gentle yet "transparent"** when used in body text but would display some **original traits** when used in larger sizes. He used **classical proportions** (particularly visible in the uppercase T) to give the letterforms harmony and elegance. At the same time, he created a sleek sans serif look, which makes evident the fact that *Lato* was designed in 2010—even though it does not follow any current trend.

The semi-rounded details of the letters give *Lato* a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides **stability and seriousness**. "Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer," says Łukasz. Learn more at [www.latofonts.com](https://www.latofonts.com).
